\section*{Part 1 - APT Campaign Questions}
\label{sec:part-1}
\subsection*{Exercise Set 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Dwell time is the number of days from when an attacker first compromises
  the victim to when the attacker is finally detected. The decrease in median dwell
  time over the past year can be attributed to the improvement of "internal hunting
  capabilities" and "enhanced network, endpoint and cloud-service provider visibility."~\cite{m-trend}
  \item Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are "generally focused on espionage activities."
  \begin{itemize}
    \item APT37 ("Reaper") - Active since 2012, APT37 primarily targets organizations
    in South Korea, but have recently started targeting Japan, Vietnam, and the
    Middle East in order to gain intelligence for North Korea's military, political,
    and economic interests.
    \item APT38 - APT38 uses destructive malware to steal hundreds of millions of dollars
    from financial institutions. This group is linked to North Korean espionage operators.
    \item APT39 - APT 39 is an Iranian cyber espionage group primarily targeting the Middle East.
    It targets the telecommunications sector, travel industry and supporting IT firms,
    and the high-tech industry in order to monitor and track specific individuals and collect
    customer data for strategic purposes related to national priorities.
    \item APT40 ("Periscope") - APT40 is a Chinese espionage group that targets Southeast
    Asian countries that are important to China's "Belt and Road Initiative". The group takes
    large amounts of information from organizations in the engineering, transportation,
    and defense sectors related to maritime technologies.
  \end{itemize}
  \item The known methods of initial compromise for APT37 include phishing operations
  and strategic web compromise.
  Specifically, APT37 sent a reunification-themed email that contained a weaponized HWP attachment.
  This spearphishing attachment is a form of social engineering that relies on the victim
  to execute the attachment which compromises the victim's system. "Network intrusion detection
  systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments."~\cite{phishing}
  APT37 also used social networking and cloud platforms like Twitter, AOL, and Dropbox to relay
  commands to compromise the victim's systems. Analyzing network data for abnormal data flows and
  unexpected protocol behaviors may be useful in detecting such attacks.~\cite{web-service}
  \item A lack of investigation on infected systems may cause the victim to overlook the
  the possibility of a larger breach. After detection of malware on a system, it is important
  to understand that the piece of malware may have stemmed from a lateral movement from
  another system in the environment, and not just a new isolated attack. This understanding would
  encourage the victim to run a more thorough investigation to detect the breach.
  A poorly timed remediation may actually hurt the victim even further. If an attacker has had
  long term access to the victim, the attacker may likely have many different ways to evade eradication
  methods. As a result of a poorly time remediation, the victim could fail to eradicate the attacker
  and even complicate the investigation further prolonging the investigation and remediation process.
  This mistake can be avoided by conducting regular reviews of incident response plans, use cases,
  and playbooks in addition to properly handling and storing evidence in incident respons plans.
  Organizations should also develop guidelines and procedures for analyzing threats ion addition to
  erradication and remediation plans.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Exercise Set 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item According to MITRE~\cite{web-service}, the Web Service attack is a Command and Control
  and Defense Evasion tactic. Since this attack often uses common services that the victim
  is already using and web service providers often us SSL/TSL encryption, attackers can easily hide
  under the "expected noise" and extra level of protection.
  \item Web services commonly used in a Web Service attack:~\ref{table:web-services}
  \begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ |c|c| }
      \hline
      \textbf{Web Service} & \textbf{Examples} \\
      \hline
      Social Networking & 10  \\
      Cloud Storage     & 9   \\
      Github            & 7   \\
      Google Services   & 7   \\
      Pastebin          & 5   \\
      Blogs             & 3   \\
      Downloader        & 1   \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\label{table:web-services}
    Table of web services commonly used in a Web Service attack.}
  \end{table}
  \item Social networking platforms like Twitter, cloud storage services like Dropbox, and Github are
  often used in a Web Service attack. These services allow attackers to post content embedded with malicious
  domains or IP addresses that infect victims. A victim may be able to detect the malicious intent
  through abnormal data flows and suspicious activitywhen accessing content on these services.
